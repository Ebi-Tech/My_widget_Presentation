## Widget Presentation – Task Manager UI

This repository contains a small Flutter app that showcases a **task manager widget** with add, edit, and delete interactions.  
It is meant as a **presentation/demo project** you can make public (e.g., on GitHub) to illustrate widget composition, state management with `setState`, and different approaches to per-item actions in a list.

### What this app demonstrates

- **Task list UI**: Displays a list of tasks, each with a title and due date (`lib/screen/task_screen.dart`).
- **Inline actions**: Per-item actions for **Edit** and **Delete**, implemented in two alternative UI styles:
  - **Version 1 – `PopupMenuButton`**: Compact trailing icon that opens a menu with Edit/Delete.
  - **Version 2 – Icon buttons**: Two explicit trailing icon buttons for Edit and Delete.
- **Basic state management**: Adding, editing, and removing tasks is handled with `setState` in a `StatefulWidget`.
- **Dialog UX**: Editing a task opens an `AlertDialog` with a `TextField` and Save/Cancel actions.

> To switch between the two list-item action styles, toggle the `usePopupMenu` boolean in `_TaskScreenState` inside `lib/screen/task_screen.dart`.

### Project structure (high level)

- **`app/lib/main.dart`**: Entry point; wraps the app in `MaterialApp` and shows `TaskScreen`.
- **`app/lib/screen/task_screen.dart`**: Core UI and logic for the task list and list items.
- **Platform folders** (`android/`, `ios/`, `web/`, `macos/`, `windows/`, `linux/`): Standard Flutter scaffolding generated by `flutter create`.

All Flutter-specific configuration (e.g., dependencies) lives in `app/pubspec.yaml`.

### Getting started

- **Prerequisites**
  - Flutter SDK installed and on your `PATH` (see Flutter documentation for your OS).
  - A connected device or emulator/simulator for the platform you want to run on.

- **Clone and install dependencies**

```bash
git clone <your-public-repo-url>.git
cd Widget_presentation/app
flutter pub get
```

---

### Running the app

From the `app` directory:

- **Run on a connected device / emulator (Android, iOS, desktop, etc.):**

```bash
flutter run
```

- **Run for web (if web is enabled in your Flutter setup):**

```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

Use your IDE of choice (Android Studio, VS Code, Xcode, etc.) if you prefer GUI-based run/debug.

### Screenshot

Add a screenshot to showcase the widget in your public repo (e.g., in a `docs/` folder) and update the path below:

```markdown
![Task Manager widget screenshot](docs/widget_presentation.png)
```

This helps viewers immediately understand what the UI looks like when they land on the repository page.
